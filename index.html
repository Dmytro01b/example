				<h2 class="content__subtitle">Background</h2>
				<p class="content__text">Identifying the best place for something—where to land an emergency helicopter, for example—can becomplicated. Suitability modeling is a common approach to answering this question, factoring in multiple variables of varying importance to identify locations that best meet established criteria for a site</p>
				<div class="content__list list">
					<p class="list__text">Suitability modeling can solve a variety of problems. Examples include:</p>
					<ul class="list__unordered-list">
						<li class="list__item">Where to site a new housing development or hospital</li>
						<li class="list__item">Identifying potential wildlife habitat areas</li>
						<li class="list__item">Identifying optimum routes (i.e. cross-country mobility)</li>
						<li class="list__item">
							Where to locate firefighting crews to best fight fires in the dry season
						</li>
						<li class="list__item">Where to deploy troops in a military operation</li>
						<li class="list__item">Where to locate a new ski area</li>

				<p class="content__text">ArcGIS provides a set of geoprocessing tools and raster functions for users to perform suitability modeling that incorporates raster data. To identify possible locations, suitability analysis ranks and scores sites based on multiple weighted criteria. First, you'll define the problem, identify the criteria for solving it, and generate the input datasets required. These variables might include raster datasets (slope, for example), site attributes, proximity to point/line features, etc. Then, you'll transform the input values to a common ratio or preference scale so the criteria can be compared. Next, you'll assign weights to selected criteria and aggregate them to determine scores for each potential site. Finally, you'll use these scores to rank sites from most suitable to least suitable to identify the best possible locations for your application.
